<h1>Welcome</h1>
<h4>The Problem</h4>
Our product, Reactivity, addresses a problem that is present in many buildings
in the United States and elsewhere – energy waste. We observed through research
that a large number of businesses were not employing any form of smart control
for some of the smaller subsystems of their buildings (AC, light control, etc).
We proposed a design that uses a number of small wireless sensors and controllers
to help a home, office, or whole building control its subsystems and efficiently
minimize energy use.<br/>
<br/>
<h4>The Challenge</h4>
While designing Reactivity, we had to look 
at a number of challenges. The most prevalent challenge was ease of installation 
of the hardware. If the hardware was hard to install, no one would choose to use 
it, effectively causing Reactivity to fail in the long run. Another challenge 
was designing software that was flexible and powerful enough for an 
administrator or power user, yet easy enough that a home user could easily take 
advantage of the benefits it has to offer.<br />
<br />
<h4>Our Solution</h4>
We were able to implement a simple yet effective modular design for the 
hardware, allowing sensors and control to be mixed together in any way the end 
user wanted and we designed software with an intuitive and powerful interface. 
This meant that we could keep costs down while still keeping Reactivity a viable 
product. The mixing of sensors and controls allows the end user to effectively 
manage energy usage while keeping total cost down.<br />
<br />
The software was specially designed to make its complexity invisible to a home 
user, yet easy to approach for an expert. The use of a floor plan visual layout 
and comfortable and familiar colors and controls allows anyone who is familiar 
with using windows to easily learn the new software.<br/>
